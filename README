Auditable
=========

Auditable is a simple rails plugin that let's you keep audit logs about
whom is making what changes to your models.
You can always get the latest version of this plugin from Github:

If you're using Auditable in production please email me and give me your

or send me patches, I'm always interested in use cases.

Example
=======

Install Auditable using the plugin script:

  $ ./script/plugin install git://github.com/jamesotron/Auditable.git

Auditable will generate a model and migration called Audit, which you can
safely remove if you don't want to use the default model.
If you want to use the default Audit model then run

  $ rake db:migrate

to create the table in your database.

Now on any models you want you can simply add an acts_as_auditable line:

class WorrisomeData < ActiveRecord::Base

  acts_as_auditable

end

acts_as_auditable defaults to paranoid, so you may wish to change it, options
available are:

  :using =>
     - symbol pointing to the polymorphic model to use for storing audit
       logs. Defaults to :auditable. Only useful if you are defining your
       own Audit model.
  :relation => 
     - symbol pointing to the relationship mapping for audit logs. Defaults
       to :audits. Useful if you want to access the audit log by a method
       other than Model.audits()
  :when => []
     - an array containing symbols describing on which actions to write
       audit logs. Defaults to 
         [ :accessed, :modified, :saved, :created, :deleted ].
  :identity =>
     - lambda block containing any code needed to retrieve the user
       identifier.  Defaults to 
         lambda { "Unknown user" }. You might
       want to try something like
         lamba { ApplicationController.session[:current_user].name } 
       if you're using restful_authentication.
  :for => []
     - an array of symbols naming the model fields you wish to audit.
       Defaults to [ :all ] (:all is a special name meaning all fields).
       Note that you can never audit :id because it will cause an infinite
       loop.
  :log_field =>
     - A symbol naming the text field in the auditor model to store the
       log information in. Only useful if you need something more than the
       default Audit model.
  :identity_field =>
     - A symbol naming the string field in the auditor model to store the
       user's identity information in. Only useful if you need something
       more than the default Audit model.
